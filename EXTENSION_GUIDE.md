# enterN | Ghost Tamer Extension Guide

## What is Ghost Tamer?

Ghost Tamer is a browser extension that helps job seekers identify employers with a history of "ghosting" candidates during the hiring process. Ghosting occurs when an employer abruptly cuts off all communication with a candidate without explanation.

The extension displays data collected from our community of job seekers, showing how frequently companies ghost candidates and at which stages of the hiring process. This information helps you make more informed decisions about where to apply and what to expect during your job search.
